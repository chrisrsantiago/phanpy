Setup is farily simple.  If you haven't already downloaded the files, you can
save yourself some time by using easy_install:

    easy_install phanpy

Otherwise, just set it up:

    python setup.py install

Once that's done, you're ready to go.  The documentation is easily accessible
via Python's help().  Every module has been documented to the best of my
ability, although if the documentation needs improvement, drop a line.  That
applies to the rest of the program as well.
