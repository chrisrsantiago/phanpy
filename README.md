# phanpy

phanpy is a set of python helper functions for web apps running atop Pylons 1.0 and SUIT Framework.  This is a legacy project and is no longer
maintained, but for the sake of documenting history, I am making the source code available.

# Setup/Installation

Setup is farily simple.  If you haven't already downloaded the files, you can
save yourself some time by using easy_install:

    easy_install phanpy

If you've downloaded the source, installation is just a matter of:

    python setup.py install

Optionally, if you want to run unit tests to see if phanpy works (which is
recommended), then run:

    python setup.py nosetests

The documentation is easily accessible via Python's help().  Every module has 
been documented to the best of my ability, although if the documentation needs
improvement, drop a line citing what part specifically.  That applies to the
rest of the program as well, of course.
